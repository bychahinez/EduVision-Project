## AI-Based Solution for Proactive School Dropout Risk Prediction
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence to identify at-risk students and prevent school dropout through proactive intervention strategies. By analyzing multidimensional data including academic performance, behavior patterns, attendance, and socio-familial context, our solution helps educational institutions implement data-driven prevention measures.
### üéØ Objectives
- Identify at-risk students using multidimensional data analysis (academic performance, behavior, attendance, socio-familial context)
- Understand underlying dropout mechanisms by exploring complex interactions between academic, psychological, economic, and environmental variables
- Support educational decision-making through proactive, data-driven prevention strategies replacing reactive approaches
### üìÅ Dataset
The dataset used in this project was generated with the help of artificial intelligence to simulate data related to school dropout. This approach was necessary because real student data is usually confidential and protected by strict regulations, making it inaccessible for research purposes.

### üß† Project Workflow
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis of student demographics and performance patterns
- Visualization of risk factors distribution and correlations
- Identification of key dropout indicators
#### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Cleaning and standardizing student data
- Encoding categorical variables (participation levels, transport accessibility, behavior patterns)
- Creating multidimensional risk indicators:
        
        - Academic Difficulty Index
        - Student Motivation Score
        - Absenteeism Index
        - Transport Accessibility Score
        - Economic/Family Stability Indicators
### Risk Assessment Modeling
#### Problem Type: 
Binary Classification (Dropout Risk: 1 = at-risk, 0 = stable)
#### Class Imbalance Handling: 
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
#### Model Selection:
Ensemble approach with voting classifier
#### Model Selection Process
Because this was a binary classification task (dropout vs. no dropout), we experimented with a wide range of models to identify the most reliable one including XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, SVM, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, K-NN, and Logistic Regression , the top three models consistently delivered the highest performance :

To maximize prediction accuracy, we combined the three best-performing models (MLP, LightGBM, Random Forest) into a Voting Classifier. This ensemble approach makes the final decision based on majority voting among the models, leading to more stable and robust predictions.

#### Model Interpretability
We used SHAP for local and global prediction explanations to identify features and support the educational team .
### Personalized Intervention Recommendations
- Academic support strategies (tutoring, course reorientation)
- Transport solutions (school bus organization, mobility scholarships)
- Psychological support for family instability
- Economic assistance (study grants, free meals, school supplies)
### üìà Results
Best Model Performance (Voting Classifier):
- Accuracy: 98.68%
- Precision: 98.43%
- Recall: 98.95%
- F1-Score: 98.70%
